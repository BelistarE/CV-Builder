# CV Builder

CB builder app inspired by [OdeeyuhLog](https://github.com/OdeeyuhLog).
This app takes user information and builds a resume in real-time. Users have the
option to download the file once complete. Built using React, MUI, NextUI, RadixUI, and html2pdf.

# TODO

1. add a "current" option for job and "in progress" for education
2. add options for non-us phone numbers
